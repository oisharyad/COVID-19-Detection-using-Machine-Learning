## Introduction

The Coronavirus is increasing day by day all around the world. Not only the daily life of humans but also the economy of a country is deadly affected by SARS-CoV-2 also known as Covid-19. The medical scientist showed that Covid-19 patients suffer from lung problems. Both CT scans and X-rays are being used to diagnose coronavirus but due to low cost and time, a chest x-ray is more preferable to the other. To stop spreading the virus, quick identification of affected people is one of the top priorities. For identifying a covid patient at an early stage a deep learning-based method is proposed in this paper. A supervised learning-based algorithm with Convolutional Neural Network and ReLU activation function is used to identify Covid-19 virus from chest radiography (X-ray) images. A good amount of augmentation is done upon the dataset as the dataset is not that big which helps to generate a good prediction. The initial experiments show the model performs well on average but in covid cases, it shows exemplary results. I would like to emphasize that this approach is a pre-diagnostic step that would determine if a person needs to do the traditional test or not.

## Network Structure

The whole methodâ€™s structure can be dived into three parts: Dataset, Model and Evaluation Metrics. These three are the backbone of the whole project.
